# ☭ ComrIDE ☭

ComrIDE™ (pronounced Com-ride), is the world's first next generation communist
text editor.

## ☭ Why a communist text editor? ☭

Comrades, we have been oppressed, and some of us even labelled as "lower class
GNU-plebs", and seeing the fruit of our hard labour being taken away by the
upper class citizens infront of our eyes.

A communist text editor will help drive the Communist Revolution and hopefully
by 2017 have all major nations realise that communism is the only true
socioeconomic order.

By using ComrIDE™, you are helping push the world towards a more equal and
communist society.

## ☭ Okay, cut the communist crap, what's it got for me? ☭

How dare you dismiss communism as mere "crap"!

## ☭ I'm sorry! But are there any cool features? ☭

Yes of course! Using our new state-of-the-art next generation revolutionary
Link™ technology, ComrIDE will have the ability to integrate with various
TeamLe-Shop software, such as:

- DasForum™
- Other stuff

Along with other common services, like FTP!

It will also have the ability to collaborate LIVE™ with your comrades.
ComrIDE will ensure that your peers are also working hard in the communist
spirit, and that you all enjoy the fruit of your labour.

In the wise words of Vladimir Lenin, "Communism Pasta Race".

## ☭ What our comrades holla'd 'bout us? ☭

"wow this is really good" - Vladimir Linsky
"i feel like a communist already" - other people
